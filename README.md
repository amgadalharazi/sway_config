## Purpose of This Repository

I created this repository to back up my system customizations. Since I often reformat my device—usually after messing around with the kernel—I tend to forget to back everything up. Reapplying my setup from scratch takes a lot of time and effort, so this repository helps me restore everything quickly and avoid that headache in the future.
